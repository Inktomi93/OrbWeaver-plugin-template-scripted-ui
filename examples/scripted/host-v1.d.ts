// host-v1.d.ts — the PUBLISHED TypeScript surface of the Orbweaver plugin host, version 1.
//
// COPY THIS FILE next to your `main.js` (and `ui.js`, if you ship one) and any TypeScript-aware editor gives
// you completion and type-checking against the whole host API in plain JavaScript — no build step, no
// package. It is a SCRIPT-kind declaration file on purpose: no imports, no exports, so every name below is
// simply in scope for your project the moment the file exists.
//
// IT IS A MIRROR, NOT A SOURCE. The one true contract lives in the application
// (`@orb/contracts/plugin` — host-v1.ts, manifest.ts, ui.ts); this file re-states it for authors outside the
// repository and is PINNED byte-for-meaning against it by a conformance test
// (`tests/contracts/plugin/host-v1.test-d.ts`) — a drifted mirror fails the application's own build. Two
// deliberate simplifications, both author-invisible: the app's BRANDED ids (`ChatHandle`, asset/character
// ids) appear here as `string` with their semantics documented — a guest never constructs one, only passes
// them back — and internal enforcement-map types are omitted (they gate the HOST side, not yours).
//
// The realm rules these types cannot express, restated because they bite:
//   - Registrations run at ACTIVATION; an UNGRANTED host call THROWS. Feature-detect with
//     `host.grants.includes("…")` before every registration (the guard idiom).
//   - There is no `Date`, no `Math.random`, no timers, no `fetch`, no module loader. Time and entropy are
//     the injected seams below.
//   - Every host call rejects after a 5 s real-time bound; three consecutive crashed invocations
//     auto-disable the plugin.
//   - Handlers must never throw: wrap, log, return.
