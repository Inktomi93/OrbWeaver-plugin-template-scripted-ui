# Authoring contract

The manifest is the authority for identity, entry files, capabilities and optional assets. Never add undeclared network, frame or UI abilities. Server code calls `orb.host(1)`; scripted browser code calls `orb.ui(1)`. Register surfaces and commands during activation. Command placements are closed host metadata (`composer-action` and `composer-media`); the host owns attribution, grouping, overflow, keyboard access and invocation. Scripted surfaces publish sealed node trees. Frames receive an isolated document and message only through the frame bridge exposed by `@orb/plugin-sdk/frame`. Bundle roots contain `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `ui.js` only when `uiEntry` declares it.

## Assets

House-rendered scripted UI may use installed bundle assets through the SDK's `ui/assets/*` mapping. Asset URLs inside isolated frames are not yet a public contract; keep frame illustrations inline and within the documented frame bounds until that capability ships.
